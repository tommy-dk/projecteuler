This project contains my solutions to the problems stated at ProjectEuler.net

I primarily use Python to find the solutions, but I also use a little shell scripting to help me find the results.

Project Euler has a lot of entertaining problems and many ways to solve them, so when I decided I would learn Python I could combinate these things. 
With Project Euler the specific problems range from one liners to about 100 lines of code. And the problems ensure that I get all around Python and learn a lot of different stuff.
